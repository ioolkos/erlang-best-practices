# Erlang Best Practices

A collection of resources and recommendations on [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org/)

I'll shoot snippets towards this repo as they come up. Contributions welcome. In the best case, this ends up being a collection of code snippets and discussions.

This is modelled after the great Scala Best Practices repo: https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices
